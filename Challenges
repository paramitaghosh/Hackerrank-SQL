Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges
created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number 
of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the
maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

====================================

/* count total submissions of challenges of each user */
WITH data
AS
(
SELECT c.hacker_id as id, h.name as name, count(c.hacker_id) as counter
FROM Hackers h
JOIN Challenges c on c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
GROUP BY c.hacker_id, h.name
)
/* select records from above */
SELECT id,name,counter
FROM data
WHERE
counter=(SELECT max(counter) FROM data) /*select user that has max count submission*/
OR
counter in (SELECT counter FROM data
GROUP BY counter
HAVING count(counter)=1 ) /*filter out the submission count which is unique*/
ORDER BY counter desc, id
